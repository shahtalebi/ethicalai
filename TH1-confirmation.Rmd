## Disassembling Platforms, Reassembling Sociality

*Van Dijck, José. "Disassembling Platforms, Reassembling Sociality." _The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media_ (2013): 24-43*

**Reflections by:** Véronique Hamel and Alexandre Pouliot. 

### Introduction
Van Dijk starts this chapter by briefly presenting the coevolution of the music platform ITunes and the music industry on economic and legal grounds. He introduces the idea that, to better understand the reciprocal influence of microsystems on their surrounding ecosystems, it is useful to distinguish between the use of a given technology by users and the socio-economic structure behind this technology. The goal of this dual analysis is then to recognize common norms and mechanisms through the interoperability of different platforms.

>“we can distinguish five significant concepts that help unpack the technological dimension: (meta)data, algorithm, protocol, interface, and default. These terms have in common meanings that carry beyond the technological realm into the social and the cultural.” (p.31)

### Layer 1: Platforms as technocultural constructs
#### Element 1: Technology
The author is interested in the sociocultural aspect of a platform’s different technological components, since the very architecture of softwares and web platforms is the result social dynamics and norms that got encoded in the structure. “Data” encompass individual and collective properties, like a name, a phone number, derivative products, like buying suggestions on Amazon. Protocols define the frame of conversations between different actors about privacy and subversion. In turn, default features regulate users’ behavior on those platforms.
> “The confrontation between implicit usage and explicit use embodies part of a negotiation process between platform owners and users to control the conditions for information exchange; such struggle also bares disputed norms and values.” (p.35)

#### Element 2: Usage-users
Van Dijk draws a distinction between the implicit and explicit user of a platform. Implicit user limits himself to the interactions that were built in the architecture of the platform and does not go further. The explicit user, however, departs from default interactions and changes the parameters of the platform by his very activity on the platform. This explicit user is visible in statistics and demographics and can be studied as an experimental or an ethnographic subject.

> “Users and owners share the objective of having “good content” flow sinuously through the ecosystem’s arteries, but their interests also diverge. First of all, where users favor multiple forms and formats, platforms prefer standardization of content and uniform deliverance.” (p.36)

#### Element 3: Content
A platform’s content is shaped in constant negotiation between the various interests and tastes of users and the professional standardisation will of owners. Both have the goal of creating “good content”, but opinions may vary on what criteria establish “goodness”, thus the constant negotiation.

### Layer 2: Platforms as socioeconomic structures

#### Element 4: Ownership
van Dijk defines ownership models as to who owns the platform and places different models on a spectrum that goes from totally for-profit, investor-owned platforms (Facebook) to totally nonprofit and nonmarket ones. Now, however, there are a lot of partnerships to share data and integrate each other’s functions between platforms.
> “[...] even as little as ten years ago, the coding of social actions into proprietary algorithms, let alone the branding and patenting of these processes, would have been unthinkable.” (p.37)

#### Element 5: Gouvernance
The author defines gouvernance as “how, and through what mechanisms, communication and data traffic are managed.” (p.38). The main gouvernance issues on social media platforms are inscribed in end-user license agreement (EULA) and terms of services (ToS). However, as van Dijk notes, most users do not read them and the law is not optimal for this realm, so there are alot of grey areas that lead to user discontent or problematic practices.
> “Facebook’s privacy policy, for one thing, is known to be more complicated and longer than the U.S. Constitution. Even without reading the rules, though, Facebook users encounter changes in gouvernance through altered interfaces, usually without formal notice from the platform’s owner [...]” (p.38)

#### Element 6: Business Model
Business models are, in short,social media platforms make money out of their activity. While some of them use pop-up adds, most platforms find this practice risky because it risks putting off their precious users. Hence, marketing practices of the cultural industry on social media platforms are constantly changing, using ‘influencers’ and friend or algorithmic suggestions to publicize other products and make money out of this publicity. Selling metadata (with users’ by default agreement) is another common business model.

> “Sophisticated mathematical models for analyzing aggregated data and predicting social trends are turning the incessant flow of data into a potentially lucrative connective resource.” (p.40-41)

### Conclusion
van Dijk closes his chapter by reaffirming that social media platforms shape sociality just as much as sociality informs those same platforms. Moreover, one must always keep in mind that any given platform takes place in a constellation of other platforms and that relations between them constantly oscillate between collaboration and competition. Finally, analyzing social media and algorithms require a multidisciplinary approach to do justice to the complexity and multifaceted nature of the phenomenon.
